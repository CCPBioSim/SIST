# SIST: stress-induced structural transitions in superhelical DNA 

## Purpose of SIST

The codes in this repository are for analyzing three types of structural transitions in superhelical DNA molecules of specified base sequences and kilobase lengths.  These are strand separation, BZ transitions and cruciform extrusion.  More types of transitions may be added as their energetics become known.  The statistical mechanical methods and algorithms used in these analyses are described in the papers cited below.
